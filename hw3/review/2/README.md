# Completed Part

- Successfully render list by typing and submitting through input bar
- When you click the checkbox, it will render the new css style
- If you click the button "completed" below, it will filter and show the completed items
- If you click the button "active" below, it will filter and show the active items

# Missing Part or You can call it Bug QQ

- The checkbox click mechanism will always return 0 to function, which means you'll always see the first item changed QAQ
- The buttons in footer is "one-way road", which means you cannot get back to previous status QAQ again 

# Other

- I think it is interesting to rewrite the structure of code. In the beginning, I package all the things in one file in an ugly way.
- After keeping trying, I split them into plenty of files and connect them by import and export.
